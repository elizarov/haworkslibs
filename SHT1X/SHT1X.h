// Hardware connections and notes:
//
// The SHT1x sensor only has two signals, clock and data. The clock goes to 
// Arduino pin 3 and the data pin goes to pin 4. It is a good idea to include a 
// 1K series resistor on both pins. If there is any problem with data integrity,
// a 20k pull-up resistor can be attached to the data pin. The SHT1x sensors 
// run on the 5V supply, so level translation is not required. For future improvment,
// if a 10k pull-up resistor is installed on the data line, then driving the line
// from Arduino is simpler -- the data port bit can be set to zero and left there.
// then just changing the port from output to input mode is all that is needed to
// send a zero or one, or read an input bit.
